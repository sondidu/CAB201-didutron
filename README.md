# What is Didutron?

It's a CLI program for CAB201 Assignment 2 in Semester 1, 2024. The program is essentially a grid-coordinate system that can add obstacles, detect obstacles, create a map of some area of the grid, and find a valid path between two points. The goal of this program is to understand OOP and apply best-practice programming principles.

## Implementation
- OOP principles to define various types of obstacles, exceptions, and constants
- A tree-like structure to handle CLI commands
- A* algorithm for pathfinding
- Separate files into different folders for cohesion

## My Thoughts

I personally enjoyed my time in this unit (CAB201) and there was never a moment or aspect I disliked. When I was creating this program, I spent around 2 weeks just planning everything before getting into coding. In the end, I am satisfied with how my code turned out. One feedback I received from my unit coordinator, Tim, is that I overdid the command-taking. I also received feedback that some responsibilities could either be in a separate class or that some classes had a bit too many responsibilities. After receiving this feedback, I realized there were ways I could have done things differently. In the end, I learned a lot and had fun doing so ðŸ˜†.
